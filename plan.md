- **Learning Flow:** See example → feel inspired → inspect code → understand implementation

### Color Code Styling:
- **Hex Codes:** Styled to appear in their actual color
- **Format:** `<span style="color: #HEXCODE; font-weight: normal;"><code>#HEXCODE</code></span>`
- **Purpose:** Visual learning connection between code and result

### Link Standards:
- **CodePen:** All references point to `https://codepen.io/pen/`
