Then along comes this brilliant scientist named Tim Berners-Lee working at CERN - a massive science laboratory in Switzerland where they study the tiniest particles in the universe! Tim had this wild idea that seemed impossible at the time: \"What if scientists anywhere in the world could instantly share their research just by clicking on words that connect to other documents?\"</p> <p>Most people thought he was dreaming too big, but Tim didn't give up. He spent months writing code, creating the very first web browser, and building what would become the foundation of everything we use today. When Tim was just 34 years old (only 23 years older than you are now!), he created the World Wide Web. The very first website went live on August 6, 1991 - that's over 30 years ago! It looked nothing like the colorful, interactive websites you see today. There were no videos, no photos, no fancy fonts, no games - just plain black text on a white background explaining what this \"World Wide Web\" thing was supposed to do.</p>"},{"location":"#amazing-web-trivia-just-for-you","title":"Amazing Web Trivia Just for YouWebsite Growth Over Time","text":"<p>Here's where it gets really cool, Myra! Tim's first web browser was actually called \"WorldWideWeb\" - yes, the same name as the web itself! Can you imagine how confusing that was? People would say \"I'm using the WorldWideWeb to browse the World Wide Web!\" So they renamed the browser to \"Nexus\" to avoid all the confusion.</p> <p>And here's something absolutely amazing - the very first website is STILL online today! You can actually visit it right now at http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html and see exactly what the web looked like when it was born. It's like visiting a historical monument, but in cyberspace!</p> <p>But here's the most incredible part of all: Tim Berners-Lee could have become the richest person on Earth by putting a patent on his invention. Think about it - every time someone used the web, they would have had to pay him money! But instead, he gave it away completely FREE to the entire world because he believed everyone should have access to information and knowledge. That decision changed everything for billions of people, including you and me.</p> <p>Want to know just how remarkable the web's growth has been? Let's look at some impressive numbers:</p> <pre><code>graph LR\n    A[\"1991&lt;br/&gt;1 website\"] --&gt; B[\"1993&lt;br/&gt;623 websites\"]\n    B --&gt; C[\"1996&lt;br/&gt;100,000 websites\"]\n    C --&gt; D[\"2000&lt;br/&gt;17 million websites\"]\n    D --&gt; E[\"2010&lt;br/&gt;207 million websites\"]\n    E --&gt; F[\"2024&lt;br/&gt;1.8+ BILLION websites\"]\n\n    style A fill:#ff9999\n    style B fill:#ffcc99\n    style C fill:#99ccff\n    style D fill:#99ff99\n    style E fill:#cc99ff\n    style F fill:#ff99cc</code></pre>  *From just 1 website to over 1.8 billion in just 33 years!*  <p>Now that you understand how the web exploded from Tim's single idea into this massive digital universe, let's explore why HTML is the perfect creative medium for someone with your unique talents.</p>"},{"location":"#why-html-is-perfect-for-creative-minds-like-yours","title":"Why HTML is Perfect for Creative Minds Like Yours","text":"<p>You know how you love creating art with your favorite colors - teal, purple, and yellow? Well, Myra, HTML is like having an infinite digital art canvas that never runs out of paint, never tears, and can be shared with people all around the world instantly! But what makes HTML truly special is how it combines the two things you love most: math and art.</p>"},{"location":"#html-your-math-brain-pure-magic","title":"HTML + Your Math Brain = Pure Magic!","text":"<p>Here's something that will connect to your love of math, Myra: colors in HTML are actually mathematical formulas! Your favorite teal color? It's <code>#2dd4bf</code> - which is actually a mathematical recipe telling the computer to mix specific amounts of red, green, and blue light. It's like being a scientist in a color laboratory! Web pages use coordinate systems just like the graphs you love in math class, where every element has an exact position measured in pixels. Everything on a webpage has precise proportions, measurements, and mathematical relationships. Your mathematical mind will start seeing patterns everywhere - in the spacing between elements, in the golden ratio used for beautiful layouts, even in how CSS Grid uses mathematical principles to organize content!</p>"},{"location":"#html-your-artistic-soul-beautiful-digital-masterpieces","title":"HTML + Your Artistic Soul = Beautiful Digital Masterpieces!","text":"<p>Imagine being able to paint with code using any of the 16.7 million colors that computers can display, Myra! You can create layouts more flexible than any physical canvas, design interactive art that responds to people's mouse movements and clicks, build digital galleries to showcase your real artwork, and even create animations that bring your creations to life.

It was the first browser that could actually show pictures! Can you imagine using the internet without any images, Myra? Before Mosaic, the web was just black text on gray backgrounds - no photos, no colors, no fun graphics at all.</p> <p>Then in 1994, Netscape Navigator burst onto the scene and changed everything. It made the web colorful, fast, and actually fun to use! Netscape became so popular that by 1995, almost everyone was using it. But then the giant Microsoft decided they wanted a piece of the action, so they created Internet Explorer and started what people called \"the Browser Wars\" - companies fighting to make the best browser!</p>"},{"location":"#the-2000s-the-revolution-begins","title":"The 2000s - The Revolution Begins","text":"<p>In 2003, Apple surprised everyone by releasing Safari, a browser so beautiful and fast that it felt like magic. Around the same time, a group of passionate developers created Mozilla Firefox in 2004, giving people the freedom to customize their browsing experience like never before.</p> <p>But the biggest shock came in 2008 when Google - a search company! - released Chrome.

Today, if an ad gets even 1% of people to click it, that's considered successful.</p> <p>Here's something cool about Google Chrome's logo, Myra: those colors aren't random! They're actually based on the mathematical color theory you love studying. The blue, red, yellow, and green represent the RGB color model that computers use to create all colors on screen.</p> <p>Safari got its name because Apple wanted people to think of \"going on a safari\" to explore the internet jungle - discovering new and exciting websites like an adventure! And the word \"browser\" itself was chosen because you \"browse\" through information, just like browsing through books in a library or clothes in a store.</p> <p>Want to see something really cool?

That means the web existed for 2 whole years with absolutely NO IMAGES. Can you imagine Instagram or YouTube without any pictures or videos? It would be impossible!</p> <p>And here's something that will connect to your love of math: the <code>&lt;TABLE&gt;</code> tag was originally created specifically to display mathematical data and scientific research - exactly the kind of work you enjoy!

Many gorgeous websites use these proportions without most people even realizing it.</p> <p>Fibonacci sequences - a number pattern like 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... - sometimes appear in website design, especially in how sites adapt to different screen sizes. It's the same pattern you find when counting flower petals! Check out this fun explanation of how nature uses this pattern.</p> <p>And all those beautiful color combinations you see on websites?
