## 🚀 Quick Start - Your First HTML File

Once you have either setup working, here's the simple 4-step process to create any HTML file:

1. **Create a new file** in your text editor (or new pen in CodePen)
2. **Add the basic HTML structure** (DOCTYPE, html, head, body tags)
3. **Add your content** - start simple with "Hello World!"
4. **Open in browser** to see your creation come to life!

**Pro Tip:** Start every coding session with a simple "Hello World!" page to make sure everything is working perfectly, then build from there!
